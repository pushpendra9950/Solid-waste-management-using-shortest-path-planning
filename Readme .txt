The algorithm Dustbin_route.ipynb is used to obtain the optimal route/sequence of nodes that our dustbin will follow to collect waste.


The algorithm Truck_route.ipynb is used to obtain the optimal path to be followed by the truck.


Path_simulation.blend is the simulation for the paths followed by a Dustbin and waste collection truck.
